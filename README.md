AI-Powered Restaurant Finder üó∫Ô∏è‚ú®
This is a web-based restaurant recommendation system that helps users discover places to eat either near their current location or along a planned road trip route. It uses open-source mapping technologies (Leaflet.js and OpenStreetMap) and is enhanced with Google's Gemini API for smart, AI-powered suggestions.

Features
Dual Modes:

üìç Nearby Mode: Find restaurants within a specific radius (e.g., 1km, 5km) of your current location or a manually entered address.

üöó Road Trip Mode: Plan a route by entering a start and end destination, and then find restaurants on-demand near your current location along that route.

Interactive Map: Displays your location, the search area, and restaurant locations on a dynamic map powered by Leaflet.js.

Flexible Location Input: Use your device's GPS or manually type in any address, city, or landmark.

AI-Powered Recommendations: After a search, click the "‚ú® Help Me Decide" button to get a creative, one-paragraph suggestion from the Gemini API to help you choose a restaurant.

Detailed Results: Each restaurant card shows its name, a full address, its distance from you, and provides direct links to view it on Google Maps and get directions.

API-Key-Free Mapping: The core mapping, routing, and geocoding functionalities are built on free, open-source services (OpenStreetMap, OSRM), so no mapping API keys are required.
